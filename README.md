# GradleWebAppEclipse
Basic Web app built and executed by Gradle

* clone the project into some dir on your local PC
* go to project root directory using Windows Command Prompt (Win+R) and simply execute the Gradle command from the command line:
<b>gradlew jettyRunWar</b>

* Now you should see the Gradle telling you the URL of my awesome website:
> Building 80% > :jettyRunWar > Running at http://localhost:8080/GradleWebAppEclipse

* If you open the browser and go to this URL you will see the projects root directory. Just click the login.html file. Else follow the link: <a href>http://localhost:8080/GradleWebAppEclipse/login.html</a>

* You should see the login page. Login as 'John Smith' password: john1

* You should be forwarded to the home page with the message Welcome!

NB: you dont need eclipse to run the project
